= Setup
Assuming you have a working installation and created a template in your proxmox then you can leverage this terraform code to create a new VMs.

== Updates
The main.tf file does not really need to be changed as I have included all the required variables in the variables.tf file.

== Usage
Once you git clone this repo you can run the terraform init command to download the required modules.

== Terraform.tfvars
I have included a terraform.tfvars.example file which you can use as a template to create your own terraform.tfvars file. 

== Creating the VM
Once you have your terraform.tfvars file you can run the terraform apply command to create your VM.

== Output

.codeblock: terraform creating one vm.
